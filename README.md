## Hi, I'm a Software Engineering Intern Candidate 👋

I am a software engineer focused on building scalable, data-driven systems and clean, user-centric applications. My work sits at the intersection of backend engineering, data infrastructure, and interactive web systems, with a strong emphasis on performance, reliability, and real-world impact.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack

* Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, SQL
* Web & Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Mapbox GL JS, Data Visualization
* Backend & Data Systems:** Flask, Node.js, Express, RESTful APIs, Async I/O, ETL Pipelines
* Databases & Cloud:** PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Redis, AWS, Docker, Linux, CI/CD

### 🚀 What I Build

* Scalable full-stack applications with clean architecture and maintainable APIs
* Data-intensive systems involving geospatial data, real-time pipelines, and analytics
* Backend services optimized for performance, reliability, and extensibility

### 💡 Engineering Values

* **Pragmatic scalability:** design systems that work now and scale later
* **Clarity over complexity:** write readable, well-structured, and testable code
* **End-to-end ownership:** from system design to deployment and optimization
* **Data-driven thinking:** use data to guide product and engineering decisions
* **Continuous learning:** iterate fast, ship fast, and improve with feedback

### 🎯 Current Focus
